RETRO SYNTHESIZER
=======================

I'm interested on making synthesizers with the sound of old hardware, particulary, consoles like
Sega Megadrive, Sega Mastersystem, NES, SNES, etc...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of my work will be based on Arduino MEGA, as soon as I get a Teensy since it has USB MIDI emulation.
Any suggestions and comments will be welcome!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I apologise for this ugly readme, it's under construction :)
